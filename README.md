BITStrade
=========

Code for a ad based selling website

HOW TO USE my code:

1) get an apache server running on your laptop. I use XAMPP which is an appliaction which gives you several packages like MySQL, Filezilla etc etc. WampServer is an alternative to XAMPP
2) pull down my php code
3) go to PHPmyAdmin on your Xampp and set up the database required. If you don't want to alter names in the code. set up the database as follows:
	make new database 'bitstrade'
	create 2 tables: a)users b)sell
	in users: two columns: nick,password
	in sell: id,nick,name,hostel,product,details,price,contact
		note:ID set on auto-increment
4)that's it. You are good to go. Make commits on styling, or any way you can make the website more secure.
